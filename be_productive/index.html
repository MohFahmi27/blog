It’s always better to just take some action, because if we do not take action usually we tend to lose some of the opportunity to make you improve as a developer.
Always think about what could be the worst happen if you pick wrong decisions, usually things not going to be as bad as you might think.
It’s like driving a car, you can start driving in wrong directions but always have a chance to go back and fix your directions.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Start with Small Task</h1>Doing large tasks is making us defensive because if we look at something so big it feels like it is impossible. For example eating the elephant, you can’t eat the elephant as the whole you need to eat it chunk by chunk.
You need to find a way to disintegrate large tasks into smaller chunks.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Creating Quota</h1>Quota is some activity that you need to commit every certain time, for example practice coding every day for 2 hour.
Quota could make you be productive at a consistent time.
The idea of quota is to make a new routine to your life.
This also trained you to develop new positive habits along the way.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Schedule your Activity</h1>Usually start with likeable activities then do less likeable activities later on.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Habit</h1>Habit is different from routine because usually it is hard to control our habit.
Habits usually come with three stages which are cue, activity, and reward. Cue is the trigger of the habit, activity is the habit itself, and reward is the after taste of the activity.
It’s important to recognize the bad habit.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Conclusion</h1>Productivity is the most important thing that we need to have especially as developers. Usually it is hard for us to do some productivity tasks rather than unproductivity tasks because productivity always comes with the feeling of being boring, we also need motivation to do some productivity activity. Start to develop some habit or routine because it is always the best solution to make yourself more productive. Remember that every single routine or habit that you have now will have consequences in the future, hence the reason why you need to develop a positive routine and habit.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section></body></html>
