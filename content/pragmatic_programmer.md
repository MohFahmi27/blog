{{< title-content >}}What is Pragmatic?{{< /title-content >}}
Pragmatic is the behavior of a person that prioritizes practical rather than theoretical.

Becoming a pragmatic programmer could make the difference between any other programmer.

Pragmatic programmers determine by how the attitudes, styles, and how to solve problems.

Being pragmatic not only distinguishes you from any other programmers but also makes decision making and adaptability of a person better.

{{< title-content >}}Responsibility is Important{{< /title-content >}}
Being someone responsible is one of the best ways to become a better person.

Try to explain your problem if there is something wrong, don't try to blame your mistake on someone else.

Before you want to fix your mistake try to analyze your problem and try to question yourself whether there is still a thing that you could do before pushing the help button or sink button.

It’s okay to feel weak because fear of appearing weak could lead you to something that you don’t want.

Everyone makes mistakes and there will always be light at the end of the tunnel.

{{< title-content >}}Technical Debt{{< /title-content >}}
Technical debt is the term that every software engineer should pay attention to, technical debt is the term used to describe anomalies or disorders that might happen after the process of the development finishes.

One way to prevent us from having technical debt is being aware of the system, aware of faults or any particular things that might bring something bad for the system.

The best way to describe is imagine that technical debt is broken window on the building, if you think about it if a building have broken window it looks like the building already feels like abandon and waiting for decay, same as the software if you find something like broken window try to fix it as soon as possible so it will not going to be accumulated.

{{< title-content >}}Try to see the Bigger Picture{{< /title-content >}}
When you are in the development process try to think about the bigger picture and not to always look at certain areas.

This also will help you to see much more opportunities and answer to your problem or harsh situation.

{{< title-content >}}Don’t Chase Perfection{{< /title-content >}}
We know that perfection is something that we need to do in every single thing in our life.
But when it comes to being perfect all the time will make you chase endless things. What I mean by this is that if you try to make something perfect your consciousness will always try to come up with something much more perfect which prevents you from finishing your work.
Trying to have the mentality of being enough is the new perfection.
Always make sure that you prioritize the things that fulfill your requirements.

{{< title-content >}}Conclusion{{< /title-content >}}
Being pragmatic in programming still brings me to the confusion of what it means and what value did I get by being pragmatic. But at the end of the day being someone that learns constantly every single time opportunity comes in is the best way to live as a person. Being pragmatic also makes you realize that no matter what you receive or what you read that does not mean the actual truth, never underestimate your assumptions and always prioritize facts and data.
