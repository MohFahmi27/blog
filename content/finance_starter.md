Never spend all your paycheck in one day.

Try to calculate all your expenses.

{{< title-content >}}Assets and Liabilities{{< /title-content >}}
Assets is something that will make money go into your wallet, liabilities is something that will make your money go away from your wallet.

Always focus on assets because this will affect you a lot in the long term.

Not all the liabilities are bad though, for example food, house rent, and insurance. What you wanna do is always try to mitigate all your expenses on liabilities. 

Try to begin investing in the stock market or real estate.
