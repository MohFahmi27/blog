{{< title-content >}}Why is non verbal communication important?{{< /title-content >}}
Most of our communication doesn’t just go through word and sound but also the movement of our body also playing a big role in our daily communication, this has been proved by some studies suggesting that non verbal communication plays a 55% ratio for delivering the effective message.
One of the reasons why we need to learn about body language is that through body language we can expect what people try to say and want, this will result in happier relationships and effective communication.
Body language is very hard to manipulate because our body have some mechanism to automatically express what’s in our mind through gesture or movement. It has been said that our subconscious controls our non verbal, hence the reason why we hardly manipulate non verbal.
There are a couple of different ways to practice to analyze other people's body language, one of them is to try to observe someone's body movement and gesture during the conversation.

{{< title-content >}}How to tell someone is lying{{< /title-content >}}
There are couples of the pattern that usually people do when they lie about something, this also sometimes very hard to notice during the conversation because of how subtle and quick it could be.
First sign for someone lying is they tried to cover their mouth during the conversation, this is the most obvious sign that you could detect someone lying, this has been said that our subconscious is trying to stop yourself from telling the lie.
Second sign could be intonation of the voice during conversation, this is one of the most common things that have been known to people, usually people get so nervous, hence the reason why they change their intonation.
Third sign is that people usually touch the tip of their nose when they're trying to tell a lie. One of the reasons is that our nerves get a little bit itchy when we try to tell a lie. This sign could be one of the hardest to see during conversation.
Beside the third sign that I’ve already mentioned there are a lot of patterns of someone lying. One of the ways to tell is to recognize their subtle behaviour during the conversation.

This is where things get interesting where people usually try to hide their emotion for someone that they are attracted to.

First sign to catch someone like you is the way they behave toward their hair and their shirt, usually they try to manage their appearance as neatly as possible. This could be told by the sign of someone trying to touch or fixing their hair consistently .

Second sign would be people trying to get as near as possible to you, likely to be 15 - 45 cm near, there are 4 zones or distances that people have by their default, which you could see in one of the pictures below.

Third sign would be the feet direction during conversation. If someone is attracted to you their feet would be directly toward you which is one of the signs of how people show their interest in the conversation.

{{< title-content >}}Conclusion{{< /title-content >}}
Studying body language is crucial not only for relationships and communication but also during negotiations. If we could utilize knowledge about non verbal communication we could be having the best result or things that satisfy both parties. The most important thing is that non verbal communication is one of the biggest roles in human communication. Trying to analyze people's body language is also not a very easy task to do. We could be misinterpreted if we aren't sharp enough to observe the movement of people. Humans subconsciously react to things that they think and want to do since our body and brain are always connected.
