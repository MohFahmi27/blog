{{< title-content >}}Disagreement and angriness{{< /title-content >}}
The sign of people feeling angry or disagreement sometimes is shown by crossing hands below the chest or right in front of the chest, this body language also very common during daily conversations

One of the reasons people do this is because they feel uncomfortable or disagree with someone, usually people showing this give you a sign that they feel uncomfortable about the conversation.

Trying to observe this kind of behavior and trying to make things much easier for you by giving them space, is not a very good decision to continue the conversation much further if someone feels uncomfortable.

additional things to do is reflecting about what you have done earlier that made them uncomfortable.

{{< title-content >}}Ruler or bossy gesture{{< /title-content >}}
When someone has some sort of authority feeling or position they will have some sort of body language and movement that usually occurred when they're walking, during an interview, and during a meeting.

One of the most obvious is crossing the hand palm at the back of the body, this gesture usually exists when the president or a leader has to walk with their subordinate or member.

Opposite things will happen to their subordinate body language when they face their leader which usually they try to cross their palm in front of their body, which you could pretty much see at the image below.

Another sign of authority and ruler gesture is that people could behave like they are comfortable in their environment without some slightest worry about other people's judgement, for example like someone putting their leg on top of the table, exhaling cigarette smoke above everyone, and putting one of their hands or both hands right on the waist. 

One of the ways to deal with this type of person is to usually try to compliment them, because they really love it when someone compliments them, try to not seem as arrogant or disagree with them as much as possible because their ego is really big and hard to compete with.

{{< title-content >}}Hand gesture{{< /title-content >}}

One of the most important things that people do when they are having a conversation is usually emphasizing their word using hand movement, this is one of the reasons that observing hand gestures could lead to much deeper meaning.

It is also believed that the hand is the part of the body that is really easy to observe while in the conversation or not.
One of the signs for people that try to make a decision or process some of the thoughts in their head with their hand right on the chin, salespeople usually make this gesture as an opportunity to make them negotiate more and more. When their hand has already been off from their chin usually people have already made some decision or conclusion.

Another way people express their thought process is by biting on the tip of their glasses, if they don’t have any glasses usually it could be a pencil or pen.

Another sign is that if people get their hand in front of their front pockets it could be likely to be intention to attack or attracted sexually, intention attack could mean physically or verbally, another sign that you must observe is when someone placing their thumb right in their front pockets this have suggested that a person is have attracted to you sexually.

{{< title-content >}}Conclusion{{< /title-content >}}
Hand and others of signalling could sometimes easily observe, but we also need to be careful to misjudge or misinterpret the sign, it takes time to actually read what people think using their body movement, it is also very hard because some people might be born with different behaviour or gestures. One of the interesting things about body language is that some of the body language doesn't have the same meaning on the other side of the world hence the reason why we don’t judge or take the conclusion really early. Overall understanding of how we use our body to communicate could make our life much more interesting and full benefit. For example, a very good negotiator has a very good understanding about body language so that he could make a great deal at the end of the negotiation.
