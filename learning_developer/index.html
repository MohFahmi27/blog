Before learning something you must have a big picture first about what you wanna learn.
Define a goal, what parameter or finish line to make learning stick to the plan.
Not just learn only from one resource, different resources could provide different approaches so that some solution does not stagnance.
Doing some project that is related to the topic, play around with the topic that you wanna learn if you find yourself confused about certain things, go read or research from the resources that you already gather.
Define the scope of what you learn, find specific things that you wanna learn, don&rsquo;t just learn everything because it is impossible.
Difficulty on a topic defines how long you will plan to study the topic, you need to have an estimation about how much time you will spend to understand the topic.
After understanding the topic try to teach that topic to a person you know, this will help you to dig much deeper into the topic.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Side Note</h1>For the starter try to use pomodoro technique to stay in the focus.
Stop worrying about feeling dumb.
Find something that you don’t know first before jumping in.
Coding is like riding a bike, you will not gonna master it if you just read a book, you need to try to ride a real bike to be able to master it (we tend to learn faster based on the experience we have).</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Conclusion</h1>Learning fast is really important to developers because technology is developing really at the highest speed. Please keep in mind that every single technology has their advantages and disadvantages, hence don’t be limiting yourself to learning technology or framework or in other words don’t be too religious about technology judge the technology or framework before you use it. Be critical about what you wanna learn as well, don&rsquo;t be too optimistic about learning everything because it’s okay to not know about everything that is happening. Every point that is already stated will not work if you don’t motivate yourself to get outside your comfort zone.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section></body></html>
