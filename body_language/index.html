One of the signs for people that try to make a decision or process some of the thoughts in their head with their hand right on the chin, salespeople usually make this gesture as an opportunity to make them negotiate more and more. When their hand has already been off from their chin usually people have already made some decision or conclusion.</p><p>Another way people express their thought process is by biting on the tip of their glasses, if they don’t have any glasses usually it could be a pencil or pen.</p><p>Another sign is that if people get their hand in front of their front pockets it could be likely to be intention to attack or attracted sexually, intention attack could mean physically or verbally, another sign that you must observe is when someone placing their thumb right in their front pockets this have suggested that a person is have attracted to you sexually.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Conclusion</h1>Hand and others of signalling could sometimes easily observe, but we also need to be careful to misjudge or misinterpret the sign, it takes time to actually read what people think using their body movement, it is also very hard because some people might be born with different behaviour or gestures. One of the interesting things about body language is that some of the body language doesn&rsquo;t have the same meaning on the other side of the world hence the reason why we don’t judge or take the conclusion really early. Overall understanding of how we use our body to communicate could make our life much more interesting and full benefit. For example, a very good negotiator has a very good understanding about body language so that he could make a great deal at the end of the negotiation.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section></body></html>
