Most of our communication doesn‚Äôt just go through word and sound but also the movement of our body also playing a big role in our daily communication, this has been proved by some studies suggesting that non verbal communication plays a 55% ratio for delivering the effective message. One of the reasons why we need to learn about body language is that through body language we can expect what people try to say and want, this will result in happier relationships and effective communication.</description></item><item><title>Quote #3</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 21:03:58 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_3/</guid><description>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present.</description></item><item><title>Quote #2</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 21:02:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_2/</guid><description>The loneliest people are the kindest. The saddest people smile the brightest. The most damaged people are the wisest. All because they don&amp;rsquo;t wish to see anyone else suffer the way they did.</description></item><item><title>Body Language Communication</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/body_language/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 20:54:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/body_language/</guid><description>Disagreement and angriness The sign of people feeling angry or disagreement sometimes is shown by crossing hands below the chest or right in front of the chest, this body language also very common during daily conversations
One of the reasons people do this is because they feel uncomfortable or disagree with someone, usually people showing this give you a sign that they feel uncomfortable about the conversation.
Trying to observe this kind of behavior and trying to make things much easier for you by giving them space, is not a very good decision to continue the conversation much further if someone feels uncomfortable.</description></item><item><title>Depression</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/depression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 09:10:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/depression/</guid><description>Culture and Environment Culture and environment where you eat could be one of the things that could trigger depression. It is also interesting because some of the climate could also be affecting our depression. For example, winter is most likely to trigger depression. One of the reasons is most of the winter people do not get enough exposure to sunlight which is one of the essential sources of vitamin D.</description></item><item><title>Quote #1</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 09:08:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/quote_1/</guid><description>The world is beautiful for those who are beautiful inside.</description></item><item><title>Finance Starter</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/finance_starter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 08:57:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/finance_starter/</guid><description>Focus on long term Never spend all your paycheck in one day.
Try to calculate all your expenses.
Assets and Liabilities Assets is something that will make money go into your wallet, liabilities is something that will make your money go away from your wallet.
Always focus on assets because this will affect you a lot in the long term.
Not all the liabilities are bad though, for example food, house rent, and insurance.</description></item><item><title>Motivation of The Day</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/my_motivation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 08:10:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/my_motivation/</guid><description>Shit about to happen but sometimes others things happen too.</description></item><item><title>Positive Attitude</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/positive_attitude/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 08:00:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/positive_attitude/</guid><description>Thought could change reality There is some mysterious thing about universe and world we live in, if we believe that something happen to us or we believe what gonna happen to us soon or later it will be come true and of course it does not going to be happen instantly.

Focus on what you're doing right now Don‚Äôt live in a virtual world that is created by your mind, things that you think will happen in the future or past will affect your psychology. Meditate to appreciate the moment, start to meditate by focusing on your breath, don&amp;rsquo;t let your mind get out of control thinking about something else.
Wake Up!</description></item><item><title>Learning as Developer</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/learning_developer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 07:17:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/learning_developer/</guid><description>Learning Fast Not to learn something on the book cover to cover.
Before learning something you must have a big picture first about what you wanna learn.
Define a goal, what parameter or finish line to make learning stick to the plan.
Not just learn only from one resource, different resources could provide different approaches so that some solution does not stagnance.
Doing some project that is related to the topic, play around with the topic that you wanna learn if you find yourself confused about certain things, go read or research from the resources that you already gather.</description></item><item><title>Be Productive</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/be_productive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 06:40:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/be_productive/</guid><description>Prioritize Action Start to do some action rather than calculating all the decisions that are available. It‚Äôs always better to just take some action, because if we do not take action usually we tend to lose some of the opportunity to make you improve as a developer.
Always think about what could be the worst happen if you pick wrong decisions, usually things not going to be as bad as you might think.</description></item><item><title>First Blog Using Hugo</title><link>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 21:22:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://mohfahmi27.github.io/blog/hello_world/</guid><description>This is my first post for my personal blog, I created this blog for solely for the purpose of learning hugo and website static generator in general.</description></item></channel></rss>
