But when it comes to being perfect all the time will make you chase endless things. What I mean by this is that if you try to make something perfect your consciousness will always try to come up with something much more perfect which prevents you from finishing your work.
Trying to have the mentality of being enough is the new perfection.
Always make sure that you prioritize the things that fulfill your requirements.</p><hr><p><h1 class="title is-4 has-text-white">Conclusion</h1>Being pragmatic in programming still brings me to the confusion of what it means and what value did I get by being pragmatic. But at the end of the day being someone that learns constantly every single time opportunity comes in is the best way to live as a person. Being pragmatic also makes you realize that no matter what you receive or what you read that does not mean the actual truth, never underestimate your assumptions and always prioritize facts and data.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section></body></html>
